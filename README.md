# reactor-twilio

Example script for the [EVRYTHNG Reactor](https://developers.evrythng.com/reference#reactor) that 
allows sending of SMS messages through the [`twilio`](https://github.com/twilio/twilio-node) NPM 
module. 

The script itself requires onyl minimal changes - your Twilio Account SID and Auth Token (available 
from the [Twilio console](https://www.twilio.com/console)). Once it is set up, creating an action of 
a specific type with the message details embedded within the action will cause Twilio to send an SMS.


## Installation

1. Open the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.evrythng.com) and create a project and application.
2. Paste `main.js` from this repository as the application's Reactor script on the application page.
3. Click 'Show dependencies' and set the `dependencies` in `package.json`.
4. Save the new script using the 'Update' button.
5. Create an action type called `_sendSMS` within the same project.


## Configuration

1. Obtain your Account SID, Auth Token, and phone number from the 
   [Twilio console](https://www.twilio.com/console).
2. Insert these in the installed Reactor script as `ACCOUNT_SID`, `AUTH_TOKEN`, and `PHONE_NUMBER`.
3. Optionally, set some `PROPERTY_RULES` if required (see 'Usage Modes' below).


## Test with an SMS

Once the Reactor script is installed, and the Reactor script updated with Twilio credentials, 
sending an SMS through EVRYTHNG is simply a matter of creating an action with the message details:

* `customFields.to` - The recipient SMS number.
* `customFields.body` - The content of the SMS message.

Test by sending an HTTP request:

```
POST /actions/_sendSMS
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: $OPERATOR_API_KEY

{
  "type": "_sendSMS",
  "thng": "U4MhAkdaVD8atKwRaE4CVrYh",
  "customFields": {
    "to": "+447865784352",
    "message": "Hello from the EVRYTHNG Reactor!"
  }
}
```


## Usage Modes

### Action Creation

The script will send an SMS message when an EVRYTHNG action is created in the scope of 
the project of the `_sendSMS` type with the correct `to` and `body` `customFields`. 


### Thng Property Rules

As an alternative to action creation, the script also offers a property rules feature. If a 
project-scoped Thng has its properties changed, the list of `PROPERTY_RULES` in the script is 
examined, and any matching rules evaluated and actioned via sending the specified SMS message.

Each item in the `PROPERTY_RULES` array must take the following format:

```json
{
  "condition": "<propertyKey> <operator> <value>",
  "message": {
    "to": "<phone number>",
    "body": "<string>"
  }
}
```

Where `propertyKey` is a Thng property key, and `operator` is one of `>`, `>=`, `==`, `<`, `<=`, 
`includes`, `!=`.

An pair of example rules is shown below:

```js
const PROPERTY_RULES = [{
  condition: 'temperature_celsius > 100',
  message: {
    to: '+447794448002',
    body: 'Temperature exceeded acceptable levels!'
  }
}, {
  condition: 'weather_report includes rain',
  message: {
    to: '+447794448002',
    body: 'Rain is forecast!'
  }
}];
```
